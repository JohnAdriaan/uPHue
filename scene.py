            API. With the gen 2 of the official HUE app everything is
            organized by room groups.

            This provides a convenience way of activating scenes by group
            name and scene name. If we find exactly 1 group and 1 scene
            with the matching names, we run them.

            If we find more than one we run the first scene who has
            exactly the same lights defined as the group. This is far from
            perfect, but is convenient for setting lights symbolically (and
            can be improved later).
